<!-- 针对传统马铃薯种薯人工切块效率低、质量不稳的问题，本研究旨在开发并评估一套自动化切块机器人系统。该系统基于POD-YOLO深度学习模型识别种薯姿态、边界及关键芽眼位置，采用一种结合聚类分析与目标函数优化的切割角度计算策略智能规划切割路径，并由Delta并联机器人执行切割。通过基于单应性矩阵的相机-机器人标定实现精确视觉引导。系统性能评估表明：静态视觉引导定位误差主要在±0.5 mm范围内；所选切割策略在切割均匀性与覆盖率上表现较优；对圆形马铃薯的最高切割合格率达85 %；系统平均处理周期约 2.14 秒，对应效率约418.8 kg/h，约为熟练人工效率的3倍。研究验证了自动化切块的技术可行性，但也揭示了单顶视视角导致的芽眼信息不完整、输送带引入的动态定位误差及单刀具切割执行效率等是限制性能的关键挑战。本研究为马铃薯种薯自动化处理提供了系统性解决方案与实证数据，未来优化方向包括多传感器融合视觉、动态误差补偿控制及高效切割执行机构设计。项目源码：https://github.com/Jie-Huangi/To-Cut-Potato-Robot-03-08 -->

Addressing the low efficiency and inconsistent quality associated with manual cutting of potato seed tubers, this study aimed to develop and evaluate an automated robotic cutting system. The system utilizes a POD-YOLO deep learning model to identify the pose, boundary, and key bud eye locations of the seed tubers. It employs a cutting angle calculation strategy integrating cluster analysis and objective function optimization for intelligent cutting path planning, which is executed by a Delta parallel robot. Precise visual guidance was achieved through camera-robot calibration based on a homography matrix.

System performance evaluation indicated that the static visual guidance positioning error was primarily within ±0.5 mm. The chosen cutting strategy demonstrated superior performance in terms of cutting uniformity and coverage. The highest cutting qualification rate for round potatoes reached 85%. The system's average processing cycle was approximately 2.14 seconds, corresponding to an efficiency of about 418.8 kg/h, roughly three times that of skilled manual labor.

The study validated the technical feasibility of automated cutting but also identified key challenges limiting performance: incomplete bud eye information due to the single top-down perspective, dynamic positioning errors introduced by the conveyor belt, and the execution efficiency limitations of a single cutting tool. This research provides a systematic solution and empirical data for the automated processing of potato seed tubers. Future optimization directions include multi-sensor fusion for enhanced vision, dynamic error compensation control, and the design of more efficient cutting mechanisms.
